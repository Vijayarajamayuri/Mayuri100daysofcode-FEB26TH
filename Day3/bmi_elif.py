# Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.
# It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.
# Under 18.5 they are underweight
# Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
# Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
# Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
# Above 35 they are clinically obese.

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
height = float(input("enter your height in m: "))
weight = float(input("enter your weight in kg: "))
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
bmi = weight / (height * height)
# print(bmi)

# Method 1
# if  bmi < 35:
